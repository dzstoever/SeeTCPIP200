<h2 style="color:Black;">Product Description</h2>
<p>
SeeTCPIP provides a detailed view and analysis tool for your TCP/IP stack(s) running on VSE.  The product allows you to watch network activity on your systems in real-time and produces historical charts and reports.  It allows you to see what applications, interfaces, hosts, foreign IP addresses, and connections are consuming the most system resources.  SeeTCPIP also provides an interactive command interface.  It provides a rich, simple user-interface allowing users with varied expertise to benefit and successfully monitor your mission critical mainframe operation.

<h2 style="color:Black;">Technical Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Mainframe) Must be running CSI TCPIP 1.5E.</li>
<li>(PC) Must be running Windows 2000, XP, or Vista(testing in progress).</li>
<li>(PC) Stores all data and handles all user interaction, thus eliminating most overhead from the customers mainframe system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color:Black;">Release Notes</h2>
<h4>The user-interface has been significantly redesigned.</h4>
<h4>The product has been divided into two components.</h4>
<ol>
<li>Network communications and data collection are run and controlled silently as a "Windows Service".</li>
<li>The user-interface is a completely separate component that runs as a "Windows Application".</li>
</ol>
<p>
This allows the user to set up all of the TCP/IP systems that they are interested in and then start the "Windows Service" once and leave it running.  Once this is done, they can open and close the "Windows Application" at any time to view their system(s) activity.  So as long as the the "Windows Service" is running, information is collected on all configured systems.

<div style="border:inset; padding:10px;">
<h2 style="color:Black;">Future Plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Packet Trace Data - a detailed view of packet data. (I actually hope to have this finished for 1.5.9 but am not allowing it to delay the release)</li>
<li>Network Alerts - a feature that will allow customers to be notified if certain levels are exceeded.</li>
</ul>
